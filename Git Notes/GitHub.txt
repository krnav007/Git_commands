How to push/add existing source code or repositories to GitHub from the command line using GitHub CLI or Git Commands.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Open Git Bash in that particular folder. Type git init (this will make that folder a repository)

Step 2: Type git add . (this will add all files to the repository)

Step 3: Type git commit -m “Initial commit msg” (all files now in the repository)

Step 4. Type git status (you will get a msg, “On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean” this shows your local repository is finally created)
